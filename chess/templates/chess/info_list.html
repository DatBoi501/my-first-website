            <p>Firstly,</p>
            <h2><a href="">What is Chess?</a></h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece type moves differently. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's king for both players but draws occur often.</p>
